# Nick Shin's Programming Cheatsheets

This page will list some sample code files that I have writen and have
made available to the public domain.

These are mostly to help remind me a few bits of details that (when working
with a pile of different programming and scripting languages) I like to copy
and paste code that I use a lot (efficiently), often (lazy) or rarely (forgetful).
