#### Nick Shin's Programming Cheatsheets

This page will list some sample code files that I have writen and have
made available to the public domain.

These are mostly to help remind me a few bits of details that (when working
with a pile of different programming and scripting languages) I like to copy
and paste code that I use a lot (efficiently), often (lazy) or rarely (forgetful).

# C

## [c_cheatsheet1.c](code/c_cheatsheet1.c)

(even though patterns are normally used with Object Oriented languages)

# Vim

## [https://github.com/nickshin/vimfiles](https://github.com/nickshin/vimfiles)

- latest [vimrc](https://github.com/nickshin/vimfiles/blob/master/vimrc) file I use:
	- editor configuration
	- plugin mapings
	- and some archived configs and maps for reference

- my [vim_notes.txt](https://github.com/nickshin/vimfiles/blob/master/vim_notes.txt) on plugins &amp; stuff
	- a list of plugins i found useful in the past or currently
	- a bit of how to use them and where to find them
	- and old settings that i used to use...

- [vim_fetch.sh](https://github.com/nickshin/vimfiles/blob/master/vim_fetch.sh) plugins
	- normally, plugins only need be placed in: **.vim/bundle**
	- but sometimes, some packages needs some extra hand holding to get em working (especially when working on a bunch of different OS)
	- this script helps me remember them
